## Ingredients
* 2-4 chicken breasts
* 6 oz bag of fresh baby spinach (adjust as needed, but remember this will cook down significantly)
* 1 tbsp garlic-flavored breadcrumbs
* 1 tbsp vegetable or canola oil
* 1/4 tsp onion powder
* Salt, pepper, and oregano for sprinkling
* Pepperjack cheese (optional)

## Utensils
* Oven
* Kitchen knife
* Fork
* Measuring spoons and cups
* Pan
* Small to medium mixing bowl
* Baking sheet

## Directions

* Begin preheating a pan over medium-low heat and preheat the oven to 375F.

* Chop the spinach into moderately sized pieces.

* Once the pan is preheated, add the oil and spinach.

* Stirring frequently, allow the spinach to cook down. About 3/4 of the way through, add the garlic.

* Remove the spinach and garlic from the pan to the mixing bowl. Add the breadcrumbs, onion powder, and salt and pepper to taste. Set aside to cool.

* Slit each chicken breast down a long side, leaving the other three sides closed. This is like butterflying the chicken breast but without cutting all the way through.

* Use a fork to stuff the openings of each breast with the spinach mixture.

* If using, slice the cheese and push it into the openings of the chicken breasts, using 1-2 slices per breast.

* Transfer the chicken breasts to the baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and oregano. Bake to an internal temperature of 165F, around 35-45 minutes depending on the size of the breasts.
