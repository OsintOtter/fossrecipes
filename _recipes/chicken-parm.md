## Ingredients:
* Whole boneless chicken breast
* Vegetable oil
* Tomato sauce

_As much as is necessary to coat chicken breasts_

* Eggs
* Flour
* [Seasoned bread crumbs](/recipes/seasoned-breadcrumbs)

## Utensils:
* Baking sheet
* Frying pan or skillet
* Three large, flat bowls or plastic containers for dipping chicken breasts
* Meat tenderizing hammer
* Whisk

## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Add a generous amount of oil to the pan and heat it over medium heat until it shimmers.

2. Whisk the eggs in one of the containers for dipping the chicken breasts

3. Use the meat tenderizer to pound the chicken breasts to the desired thickness. Putting the breasts in a freezer bag will help keep the chicken from getting everywhere.

4. One at a time, coat the pounded chicken in the following order: flour, egg, breadcrumbs, egg, breadcrumbs.

5. Fry the coated chicken breasts in the pan, flipping and adding oil as necessary until the breading is golden brown. Transfer them to the baking sheet. If cooking a lot of chicken breasts, replace the oil as needed.

6. (Optional) Cover the fried, coated chicken breasts on the baking sheet with tomato sauce and add parmesan and mozzerella cheese to taste.

7. Bake chicken for 15-20 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165. Thinner breasts will require a shorter cooking time.
