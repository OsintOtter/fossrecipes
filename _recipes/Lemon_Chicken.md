## Directions
1. Heat Olive oil on low in your pan. Do not turn your heat up - we do not want it to smoke. 
2. Butterfly your chicken breast fillets and cover with saran wrap. 
3. Tenderize your fillets with hammer of your choice. 
4. Prepare your flour, paprika, old bay, salt, and pepper in a bowl. 
5. Coat your chicken in the flour mixture and set directly in the pan. Fry till golden brown and remove from pan. Turn off the heat. 
6. Finely dice your shallots and garlic. 
7. Turn your heat back on your pan, add your shallots and garlic to the pan. 
8. Cook until fragrant, DO NOT BROWN. This is important. 
9. Cut 1 lemon in half and squeeze the lemon juice into the pan. 
10. You should start boiling your water for your noodles at this time. Ensure you salt your water. 
11. Add white wine into the pan, reduce to half and scrape the fond from the bottom of the pan. 
12. Cook wine until reduced by half. 
13. Add your chicken stock and heavy cream. Stir untill ingredients are mixed together. 
14. Ensure low/medium heat is on. 
15. Let mixture come to a boil. 
16. Add the juice of the remaining lemons to the sauce. 
17. Add chicken back into pan. 
18. If you find that your sauce is too think you can add a flour and water slurry to thicken it. However this is a light thin sauce. 
19. Reduce heat to low and let chicken sit in the sauce until time to serve. 
20. Strain your noodles and let sit for 5 minutes. 
21. Serve 1 chicken breast over noodles with sauce. Garnish with a lemon if you would like.
