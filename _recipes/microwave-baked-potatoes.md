## Ingredients:
* 2-4 cleaned potatoes, with skin
* Olive Oil
* Salt
* Pepper
* Garlic powder
* Onion Powder
* Butter (optional)

## Utensils:
* Microwave
* Microwave-safe plate or baking dish (optional)

## Directions

1. Prick the potatoes several times on each side with a fork, to allow steam to escape. Your potatoes may explode if you don't.

2. Rub the potatoes with olive oil, just enough to coat them but not so much that they're dripping oil.

3. Sprinkle the potatoes with salt and pepper, being somewhat generous.

4. Place the potatoes in your microwave-safe dish, or directly on the microwave turntable. Microwave at full power for five minutes.

5. Flip the potatoes using tongs or a fork (they will be hot).

6. Microwave for an additional five minutes, or until done. Check for doneness by pushing a fork or a small knife into the middle of the potato. If the potato is cooked, it will slide in relatively easily.

7. Set the potatoes aside. In a small bowl, combine garlic powder, onion powder, and salt to taste, and just enough olive oil to make the mixture wet.

8. Slice the potatoes in half down the middle the long way, Coat the inside with the olive oil and seasoning mixture, and butter if using.
