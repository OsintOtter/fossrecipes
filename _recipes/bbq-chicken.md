## Ingredients:
* 2 whole boneless chicken breast
* 1 tbsp Olive Oil
* 1/2 cup BBQ Sauce of your choosing
* 1 tsp paprika
* 1/4 tsp onion powder
* 1/4 tsp garlic powder
* 1/4 tsp dry oregano
* 1/2 tsp salt

## Utensils:
* Cast iron skillet and cover
* Medium size bowl for coating chicken
* Measuring implements

## Directions

1. Begin preheating a cast iron skillet over slightly below medium heat. You may need to adjust the temperature down depending on your stove.

2. Mix the olive oil, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, dry oregano, and salt in a medium bowl until smooth.

3. Place the two chicken breasts in the bowl and coat evenly in the mixture.

4. Coat the skillet with cooking spray or a thin coating of vegetable oil. Lay the chicken breasts in the skillet and cover. Cook for between 5 and 7 minutes.

4. Turn the chicken over and cook covered for an additional 5-7 minutes, until the chicken reaches a safe temperature.

5. Once the chicken is fully cooked, pour half the barbecue sauce over both chicken breasts. Turn the breasts over, and pour the remaining barbecue sauce over them. Cook for another 2-3 minutes or until the barbecue sauce thickens on the chicken, using a spoon to bast the chicken with barbecue sauce from the pan.
