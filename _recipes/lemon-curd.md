## Ingredients
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 2 eggs (yolks and whites)
* 1/2 cup lemon juice (about 2-3 lemons, if you're squeezing it fresh)
* zest of 1 lemon
* 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted

## Directions

1. In a large bowl, melt the butter

2. In a separate bowl, crack the eggs and remove, as best you can, the
white stringy protein attached to the yolk.

3. Add the eggs, lemon juice, lemon zest, and sugar to the large bowl. Whisk
gently until combined.

4. Microwave for 20 seconds, and whisk again. Repeat this step until your
lemon curd reaches the desired thickness, or until it coats the back of a spoon.
You may need to decrease the microwave time as you get closer to your thickness.
You can use a fork to scoop out cooked egg fragments as needed, or skim your
lemon curd at the end.
